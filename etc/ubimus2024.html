<div class="content">
<p>Free improvisation is a musical genre that defies traditional
forms of music-making, defining itself by its absences. This creates a
particular environment that imposes challenges to those trying to learn it and
to educators inspired to teach it. Generally, ensemble practice is considered
to be the most suitable and widely accepted method for practicing the genre.
Nevertheless, should it be the only one? This article discusses the different
approaches to learning improvisation and particularly free improvisation,
proposing the use of interactive musical systems as a possible alternative to
the problem. To do so, we present a custom-designed improvisation machine as a
model example and a preliminary evaluation done it.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Defining free improvisation</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Free improvisation can be best defined by its processes and intentions rather
than its sonic output [Borgo 2022, 167], [Stenström 2009, 105] [Hickey 2009,
294]. It is conceived as spontaneous creations, with no settled prior
references (such as motifs, melodies, or chord progressions) as it is usually
the case in other improvised music genres.</p>

</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Preparing for public performance</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Nevertheless, having no predetermined structure does not mean its practitioners
have no preparation for public performance: most of them have found a way to
establish themselves as improvisers, generally through repeated ensemble
practice.</p>
</div>
<br>


<button type="button" class="collapsible">Research question</button>
<div class="content">
<p>How does a musician with no access to fellow improvisers can
accomplish some degree of proficiency in this genre?<br>
<br>Our research addresses this particular issue, proposing the use of improvising
machines as a possible solution.</p>

<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Methodology</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The study was conducted with the development of a prototype for an improvising
machine, designed for this particular musical purpose, and evaluated in a
preliminary, informal setting.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Improvising machines</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Improvising machines are a type of musical agent [Tatar and Pasquier 2019]
designed for the task of live improvisation, typically in interaction with a
musician. The development of such systems has been a recurring topic in
computer music research, dating back to the pioneering work of George Lewis in
the 80’s [Lewis 2000].</p>

<h3>Pedagogical methods for musical improvisation</h3>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Improvisation and spontaneous speech</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Musical improvisation is understood by many as a musical skill analogous to
spontaneous speech [Johnson-Laird 2002, 417] [Dobbins 1980] [Burton 2010]
[Berkowitz 2016]. This analogy is defended as a justification for the necessity
of learning to improvise, framing it as a fundamental musical skill.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">A paradox in musical education</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The case for improvisation could also be sustained by the fact that most music
performed and listened to is based on improvised genres, making a compelling case
for, at least, the presence of improvisation in general musical training. 
The paradox appears when music education curricula do the opposite of what would be
expected, with almost no space at all for improvisation courses in Western
education [Sawyer 2007].</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">History of improvisation pedagogy</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The development of pedagogical methods for improvisation has been analyzed by
Pressing (1987) and summarized in five historical stages by Hickey (2009) :
embellishment (1), patterns and models (2), problem-solving (3), play-by-ear
(4), and free improvisation (5).</p>
<p>More recent approaches to music education have followed technological
developments of the digital age, making use of a variety of available software
to enhance the acquisition of a number of musical skills. </p>

<div class="content">
<p>For instance, Fern (1995) proposes a computer program to teach jazz
improvisation, using Miles Davis’ 1954 recording of the tune <i>Four</i> as a
transcribed reference for students and a chord-scale method as a guide to
creating new improvised lines.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">YouTube</button>
<div class="content">
<p>With the advent of the World Wide Web, some educators have turned to social
media platforms such as YouTube as a means of sharing instructional material
with a broader audience at little to no cost. Unsurprisingly, the platform has
been used to teach musical improvisation, with a diverse range of methods
employed. </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Reluctance among educators</button>

<h3>Challenges to teach free improvisation</h3>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Free improvisation language</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Most modern approaches to teach improvised music belong to the language of
jazz, and that could be explained by its popularity among improvised musical
genres, as well by the fact it consists of a musical idiom with approachable
boundaries for harmonic, rhythmic and melodic discourses.</p>
<p>Aplying the analogy between musical improvisation and spontaneous speech to free
improvisation, we have a type of improvised discourse that does not belong to
any specific idiom, does not adhere to any kind of syntactic rules nor uses any
predetermined vocabulary.</p>
<div class="centeredimg">
	<img src="../feed/qi115.jpg" class="presentationimg" alt="Quartas de Improviso #115">
</div>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Boundaries for free improvisation</button>
<div class="content">
<p>A less idealist view on free improvisation “language” is offered by Menezes
(2010, 15), when pointing out that practitioners of the genre do find their own
boundaries shaped by their technical constraints and their personal database of
experiences.</p>
<p>As Borgo (2002, 184) indicates, there have been identifiable characteristics in
the output of the genre in the last decades of its practice, with a shared
range of “techniques, approaches and clichés” [Menezes 2010, 16], although not
explicitly specified by the authors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one could argue the idiom of a particular performance and its set
of rules is developed on the spot as an implicit agreement between the
musicians, that “should be able to select the proper constraints in the course
of the piece, rather than being dependent on precisely chosen ones” (Ann Farber
apud [Belgrad 1999]). Under this perspective, a freely improvised piece should
not employ prearranged material, but the decisions made by each player can
shape the musical boundaries of the performance.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Dependency on live interaction and solo playing</button>
<div class="content">
<p>This context helps us to understand why free improvisation is seen to be
dependent on interaction with other musicians, with collective engagement being
accepted as the most fruitful context for it [Bailey 1993, 105].</p>
<p>Corbett arguments for the importance of interaction in free improvisation,
implying that instead of interacting with other players, a solo improviser can
engage with their instrument, the performance space, or the audience, a
perspective that could be well integrated with Ubimus’ technologies and
practices. [Corbett 2016, 119] [Stenström 2009, 38].</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">The ensemble practice approach</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Stenström (2009, 38) defends the ensemble practice approach, arguing that
solo playing may not provide the most solid foundation for ensemble
improvisation, as the latter relies heavily on the musical interplay among its
participants.</p>
<div class="centeredimg">
	<img src="./ubimus/OrquestraErrante.jpg" class="presentationimg" alt="Fern's Masters Series">
</div>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">A restrictive view on creativity?</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Although the argument for the importance of ensemble practice can be
restrictive, free improvisation, like Ubimus practices, should not limit
musical diversity, which is exemplified by the increasing presence of musicians
with varied backgrounds coming into the genre in the latest decades [Borgo
2022, 5].</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Intersection with creative practices within Ubimus</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Free improvisation also incorporates some of the same aspects of musical
creation adopted by Ubimus (see [Keller et al. 2014]), such as the focus on the
creative process instead of the musical product, and an anti-formalist approach
to music making that embraces and deals with the presence of technological and
environmental resources and the participation of the audience.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Different approaches</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Hall (2009) offers an alternative method to learn free improvisation, compiling
exercises, and warm-ups that cover practices for groups, duets, and even solo
playing. His teaching seems to be preoccupied with the awareness needed for
improvisers to accomplish fluid interactions and subtle explorations of the
sound materials employed during a performance.</p>
<p>In another example, Crook (2006) offers a guide to learning free jazz (also
referred to as free improvisation in the book) by departing from the
understanding of conventional jazz. For him, one must be familiar with what he
is freeing himself from to be truly free.</p>
<p>Clemente et al. (2020) conducted a series of experiments with ICT and
Ubiquitous Computing in a gaming format to support free improvisation practices
with an ensemble of saxophone, observing improvements in the sonority of the
group, according to the students and teachers who participated.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Free improvisation workshops principles and contradictions</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Barbara Lange (2011) noted that improvisers’ educational values, align with
Paulo Freire’s educational principles that form the basis of Ubimus dialogics,
which highlight “the role of the horizontal exchanges among group members, the
respect for cultural diversity and the adoption of a positive attitude toward
local knowledge” [Keller et al. 2020, 9].<br>
<br>
However, Lange also observed that free improvisation workshops frequently
revolve around a teacher figure who imparts information in a one-way direction,
replicating the banking model that Freire criticized.</p>

<h3>Machine improvisation as a valuable approach</h3>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Impacts of the pandemic on music</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The pandemic had brutal impact on people’s ability to gather and play
music together.<br>
<br>Alternatives to in-person practice were explored, with low-latency network
communication being demonstrated as a somewhat promising solution for the task,
even in contexts that demanded precise synchronous interaction [Bosi et al. 2021].</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Playing remotely</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Playing remotely over the internet has been a practice in Ubimus even before
the pandemic [Schiavoni et al. 2019], suggesting this can be a reasonable
solution to bring together musicians to perform improvised music despite being
physically separated.<br>
<br>Software applications that enable remote communication or Internet
forums could facilitate the assemblage of free improvisation enthusiasts
interested in practicing from home.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Issues with remote interaction</button>
<div class="content">
<p>This approach still heavily depends upon live interaction, and the inclination
towards synchronicity may not be in Ubimus’s practices best interest.<br>
<br>Dynamics that differ from synchronized performances could bring a new dimension
to the experience, providing different ways to think about it and making room
for new pedagogical concepts that may arise from such scenarios.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rehearsing alone?</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Ensemble practice is not to be considered the only source of training for
nearly every other music genre, as they employ repetition and memorization as
part of preparations that should be performed alone.<br>
<br>When accounting for technical exercises, there is not much left for
practitioners of free improvisation to explore while unaccompanied, and solo
playing does not provide much ground for the development of the interaction
skills needed for the genre.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Lewis' ideas</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Researchers on interactive musical systems have long been interested in the
potential applications of their innovations, ranging from education to
different stages of creative practice.</p>
<p>George Lewis shares the conviction that these systems can
help us understand the inner workings of music, and particularly of
improvisation.<br>
<br>For Lewis, the ability of machines to improvise provides us with a unique
opportunity to gain insight into the mechanics of musical meaning [Lewis 2018,
5].</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">To question the passiveness of machines</button>
<div class="content">
<br>Lewis also argues that the act of developing such machines is a type of
musical discourse that goes beyond the conventions of Western music practice
[Lewis 1999, 108], questioning the model of musical interaction conceptualized
on the passiveness of computer programs merely thought as instruments, in
conformity with Ubimus concepts [Keller et al. 2020, 5].</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Machine improvisation as a valuable approach</button>
<div class="content">
<p>After these considerations, we propose the use of improvising machines as a
valuable approach to the practice of free improvisation without human
companionship, believing it should serve as an alternative to ensemble playing,
mimicking the companion of other improvisers or even providing a different kind
of interaction than what is possible with human company.</p>

<h3>Engenhoca</h3>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">What is an "engenhoca"?</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Research has been conducted on the development of a prototype for an
improvising machine, named <em>Engenhoca</em>, a Brazilian Portuguese jargon for a
machine built in an improvised manner.</p>   
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What is "Engenhoca"?</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Engenhoca is a rule-based [Tatar and Pasquier 2019] transformative system [Rowe
1992, 7] that mirrors musical concepts and personal aesthetic preferences of
the author [Barros 2021].</p>
<div class="centeredimg">
	<img src="./ubimus/Engenhoca.png" class="presentationimg" alt="Engenhoca main patch">
</div>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How does it work?</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The system analyzes incoming sounds played by a musician; decides what to play
and whether or not to play; and finally synthesizes and outputs audio in real
time. The system tries to derive its musicality from the musician it is playing
along with, while also avoiding imitation or conformity, which provides it with
a sense of agency and independence.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How was it programmed?</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Engenhoca was entirely programmed in Pure Data (Pd), a FOSS application, easily
accessible other musicians who might be interested in developing the system’s
corefunctionalities. To facilitate this, Engenhoca is also distributed as FOSS
8 , allowing its code to be studied, executed, shared, and modified. We believe
that this type of software distribution resonates with the principles of
improvisation pedagogy, and with the very idea of what freedom is.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Architecture</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The basic architecture of the system is subdivided into three main subpatches,
responsible for different musical tasks: audio analysis (1), decision-making
(2), and audio output (3).
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Audio analysis</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The audio analysis (1) subpatch is capable of discerning different
characteristics of timbre, pitch, attack, rhythm, articulation, dynamics, and
phrasing of incoming audio.</p>
<div class="centeredimg">
	<img src="./ubimus/Analysis.jpg" class="presentationimg" alt="Data flow representation of audio analysis subpatch">
</div>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Decision-making</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The decision-making (2) subpatch is subdivided into two main processes: an
orchestration subpatch that decides how many voices should be playing, and
different subpatches for each voice (comprehending five independent monophonic
virtual players).</p>
<p>Rhythmic transformations are applied over a list of durations extracted from
the input (time ellapsed between an onset and an offset), generating musical
phrases with different sizes that vary in response to the average duration of
the last phrase played by the human. The pitch transformations are applied over
pitch sets that are extracted from the input, in a style
similar to what is commonly used when composing serial atonal music.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Audio output</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The output of the system (3) works in two different ways: a digital audio
synthesizer and MIDI messages. The audio output consists of a Frequency
Modulation synthesizer [Chowning 1973], routed through stereo spatialization
and a Schroeder reverberator [Schroeder 1962].</p>
<p>Recent experiments are being conducted with the inclusion of other audio
processing and generation modules, allowing a somewhat diverse sonic output.</p>
<p>The MIDI messages provide the user an opportunity to use their own solution for
sonic output.<br>
<br>The audio input and the output are automatically recorded as raw files for each
session.</p>

<h3>Preliminary evaluation</h3>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Participants</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The system was once evaluated in an informal manner, providing some modest feedback
for the ongoing phase in which improvements are being made as part of a Master’s re-
search.<br>
We invited three undergraduate music students who had previous experience in
free improvisation to play with the system for about a week, making recordings
and observations of their experience.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Interviews</button>
<div class="content">
<p>An interview was conducted, with two open-ended questions about their
experience with the system and perspectives about using similar software as a
practice tool for free improvisation.</p>
<p>Problems recognized by the participants included the feeling their timbres were
“repetitive” and their responses “not natural” or “random”. One participant
indicated that it was difficult to find an “endpoint” to the improvisation, and
trying to “force it to react” in a desired way ultimately failed.</p>
<p>One of the students indicated that he finds it an “interesting resource”,
however, he “was not confident” about the aesthetical results of the
interaction. Another participant had a “positive evaluation”, but also thought
the interaction to be more “difficult” than those with humans. The third
participant saw “potential” for the idea, but felt the “lack of a corporeal
presence” as a downside to the interaction.</p>

<h3>Discussion and future perspectives</h3>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Reprise</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Free improvisation presents some unique challenges to musicians and
educators trying to work with it, as there’s no correct way to approach it.</p>
<p>Most improvisers accept ensemble practice as the most suitable method for
practicing the genre. This research debates whether there’s no alternative to
ensemble practice in this context, observing different approaches for free
improvisation education found in the literature, as well as suggesting
technology-assisted practices such as network communications and the use of
interactive musical systems as possible substitutes that conform with Ubimus’
practices.</p>
<p>We present <em>Engenhoca</em>, a custom-designed improvising machine under ongoing
development. The project aims to demonstrate how such machines could be
implemented, by distributing it as a FOSS application and permitting other
musicians to modify the application for their particular musical goals and
preferences.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Future perspectives</button>
<div class="content">
<p>We expect to provide future insights into the pedagogical use of such systems
by developing and evaluating them further. Moreover, to reach its goal of a
viable pedagogical tool, we expect to provide Engenhoca with different
functionalities that could help this ambition. Discussed ideas are statistical
analysis of musical data that has been played and network communication
connection that could enable different modes of interaction.</p>
